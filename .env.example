# Get these values from your Firebase project:

# 2. Select your project
# 3. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)

# 5. Copy the configuration values below

# Your Firebase API Key (starts with "AIza...")
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here

# Your Firebase Project ID (lowercase, may contain hyphens)
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here

# Your Firebase App ID (starts with "1:" followed by numbers and letters)
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration
# 3. Never commit your .env file to version control
# 4. For production, set these as environment variables in your hosting platform

# Note: These values are safe to be public as they only identify your Firebase project
# but do not grant access to your data. Real security comes from Firebase Security Rules.
